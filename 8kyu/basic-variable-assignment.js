//! BASIC VARIABLE ASSIGNMENT

//* This code should store "codewa.rs" as a variable called name but it's not working. Can you figure out why?


//? code provided 

var a == "code";
var b == "wa.rs";
var name == a + b;

//? my solution

var a = "code"
var b = "wa.rs"
var name = `${a}${b}`

//? one liner and the best/most clever 

let name = 'codewa.rs';
